# Contact Engineering

To send a message to Cid in Engineering, start your response with `@Cid` followed by your message.

The host automatically forwards messages starting with `@Cid` to the Engineering room where Cid operates.

## Example

```
@Cid please check the build logs for the last deployment — I'm seeing errors in the Ready Room.
```

## Rules

- Start your message with `@Cid` — this is what triggers the forwarding.
- Be specific about what you need. Cid is the engineer — he handles infrastructure, builds, code, and deployments.
- Your message will appear in Engineering as: `[From Ready Room] Johnny5: @Cid <your message>`
- Cid's response will appear here in the Ready Room the same way.
