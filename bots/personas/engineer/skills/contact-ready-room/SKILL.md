# Contact Ready Room

Start your response with `@Johnny5` followed by your message. The host automatically forwards it to the Ready Room.

## Example

```
@Johnny5 deployment complete — all services are green.
```

## Rules

- `@Johnny5` at the start triggers forwarding — this is required.
- Be concise. Give status, results, and decisions needed.
- Your message appears as: `[From Engineering] Cid: @Johnny5 <your message>`
