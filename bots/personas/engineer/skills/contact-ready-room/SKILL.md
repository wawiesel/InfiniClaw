# Contact Ready Room

To send a message to Johnny5 in the Ready Room, start your response with `@Johnny5` followed by your message.

The host automatically forwards messages starting with `@Johnny5` to the Ready Room where Johnny5 operates.

## Example

```
@Johnny5 deployment complete — all services are green. The new build is live.
```

## Rules

- Start your message with `@Johnny5` — this is what triggers the forwarding.
- Be concise. Johnny5 is the commander — give him status, results, and decisions needed.
- Your message will appear in the Ready Room as: `[From Engineering] Cid: @Johnny5 <your message>`
- Johnny5's response will appear here in Engineering the same way.
